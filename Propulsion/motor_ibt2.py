# This class has 7 variables: LPWMPin: Raspi pin number connected to LPWM of IBT2,
#                           RPWMPin: Raspi pin number connected to RPWM of IBT2,
#                           PWMData: This will store duticycle of PWM (range 0 to 100),
#                           forwwardMotion: This is flag that will set to 1 for forward motion,
#                           backwardMotion: This is flag that will set to 1 for backward motion,,
#                           LPWMctrl: Rpio.GPIO object for LPWMPin,
#                           RPWMctrl: Rpio.GPIO object for RPWMPin.
# This class has 1 constructor and 2 functions: moveMotor : Takes duticycle from -100 to 100 and puts puts data on forward or backward pin accordingly
#                                               printMotor: Just print motor object variable
