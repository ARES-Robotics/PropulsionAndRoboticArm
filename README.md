# PropulsionAndRoboticArm
This will have codes for propulsion and robotic arm.  

Folder 1. Propulsion_Motor_Libraries:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; It mainly has IBT2 motor python(Raspberrypi) and C++(Arduino) libraries.  
  
Folder 2. Robotic Arm Codes adn Libraries:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; It mainly has L298n motor python(Raspi) and C++(Arduino) libraries and basic Arduino robotic arm template.  

Folder3. UNO Fsi6 PWM:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; It has code to get data from FSi6 RC into UNO.  

Folder4. PythonCodes:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; keyboard_control codes are base codes and ROVER_SERVER codes are codes to run on raspberry pi.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; keyborad_controls_v03: Code used at base during IRC  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ROVER_Server_V02aIP: Code used at rover during IRC. It checks IP of base to ensure we are connected or not.   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ROVER_Server_V02: This code does not check IP.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Various folders have codes that were used to develop above main codes. Thses codes can be tested on laptop, that eleminates need of Raspi while developing .
